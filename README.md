<h1>Relay shield</h1>
<p>A relay, as its name suggests, passes on (relays) a signal, they are categorized like switches that separates high voltage devices from low voltage devices. It contains a coil of wire wrapped around an iron core. When electricity runs though the coil, the iron core exerts a magnetic force, which pulls a lever, which pushes or pulls a springy strip of metal, closing two contacts. So as long as electricity runs though the coil, the relay is “energized” and its contacts remain closed. When the power stops passing though the coil, the relay lets go and the springy strip of metal snaps back into its original position, opening the contacts.</p>

<p>We use relays for high current applications where a switch may burn out under high current. Also relays can be controlled electrically whereas switches can be only operated mechanically.</p>

<p>Please note out relay shields communicate via different pins with the arduino in the above tutorial. The pin mode declarations in the sketch above show which pins to use.</p>
